      My Web development started in 2024 after being enrolled in Ghana
      Communication Technology University. After being enrolled, I was
      introduced to FreeCodecamp by my lecturer. Even though the journey hasn't
      being easy but hoping to get there as a web developer. Some weeks ago, Our
      lecturer asked us to host one of our project from freecodecamp. Eventually
      i went to research on the internet and found out some website that can
      help me host my website for free without any charges. i found this website
      called tinny website which i can say has made hosting of website easy and
      efficient. Look actually it hasnt been easy. i started by learning HTML
      then gradually came to Css then head to php,MySQl and Javascript. Recently
      am on Javascript and it has not been easy. Actually i cant give you any
      trick or secret that can help you practice coding. Infact coding will take
      your time, your money and everything because when you start it , it
      possesses you and everything.
